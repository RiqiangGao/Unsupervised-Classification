# Learning To Classify Images Without Labels

This repo contains the implementation of our paper _Learning To Classify Images Without Labels_ by Wouter Van Gansbeke<sup>\*</sup>, Simon Vandenhende<sup>\*</sup>, Stamatios Georgoulis, Marc Proesmans and Luc Van Gool.

Code + pretrained models + configuration files will be released (in a few weeks) to produce numbers even better than in the current version of the paper.
